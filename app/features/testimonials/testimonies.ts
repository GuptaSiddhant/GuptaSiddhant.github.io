      "I Had the pleasure of working together with Sid on a couple of projects for a web design course.\nThough at the time Sid's main expertise was with graphic design he had no problem stepping out of his comfort zone and taking on advanced programming tasks. His undertakings radiates ambition and if he's not already up to the task he'll make it so he is by asking questions and tirelessly trying stuff out in his spare time.\nSid goes to the bottom with things, tries to find the best way to carry out tasks while not getting stuck on details and he works with both graphics and programming in an organized way that's a pleasure for a computer scientist to watch.\nIt's been a real pleasure and I'm sure he'll bring great value wherever he goes.",
